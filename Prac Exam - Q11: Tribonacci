Question 11 (●●●●):
The Trouble with Tribonacci
The Tribonacci series is very similar to the Fibonacci series. 
The only difference between the two is that in the Tribonacci series, you add the previous three terms instead of the previous two.

The first three values in the Tribonacci series are, by definition, 1.

After the first three values each value is the sum of the previous three.

Hence, the Tribonacci series commences: 1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,57,105, ...
